Space Theme Items and Props Starter Pack
Hi and thanks for purchasing, I hope you enjoy the pack as much as I enjoyed making it :)
Contact me at tenton3d@gmail.com - I'm happy to help or hear about any improvements / ideas on the pack.

This pack is for unity universal pipeline.


--Materials--
This poly style pack mainly uses one 512 atlas texture. View 'guide1.jpg' for extra info. 'Traffic Green' 'Traffic Red' 'Traffic Orange' are assigned to the 'Traffic Light' prefab. This is so you can animate the values if you wish
Space Props Blue Fres/Space Props Red Fres/Space Props Yellow Fres can be assigned to all objects apart from the animated planets / sun


--Shaders--

SpacePropsFresnel -
This is the main shader used to give the items a nice 'toony' look. I've set up materials with red/yellow/blue. You can adjust the Fresnel color, size and power in the shader.


PlanetRing - 
"Ring Texture" Sets texture to scroll on X on the outer ring
"Ring Speed" - Sets the speed of the scrolling

SpacePropsPlanet -
This is used on "Mini Sun" for example. Play around with the settings and colours to achieve different planet looks - You can also assign your own "swirl patterns" to get a different look.


--Scitps--
"spin" is used to rotate objects around a set object and speed. You'll notice this is used on planets and satellite wings etc.

--Star---
Shooting star uses a simple trail renderer, so if you were to animate the effect will be visible.

Thanks again
